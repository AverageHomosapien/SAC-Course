The only issue pre-update was the batch size, since the 
network dimensions were explicitly specified in the agent
running the experiments. Therefore results are valid,
however:
SAC was using batch size 256
TD3 was using batch size 100
DDPG was using batch size 64

should be using 256
_________________________
Updated SAC due to it stagnating when training - issue with target network updating

______
TD3 (single result) and DDPG being updated again
(Maybe need to check TD3 lander)
